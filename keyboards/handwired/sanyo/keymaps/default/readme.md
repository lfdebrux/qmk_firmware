# The default keymap for sanyo

This keymap tries to stay as close to the original keyboard keys, including:

- function keys above 5 are accessed using the shift key
- there are dedicated angle bracket and asterisk keys
- numpad 5 is down arrow instead of numpad 2
- there is a button on the numpad that types 0 twice
- the graph key acts as a locking AltGr
