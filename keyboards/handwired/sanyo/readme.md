Using an Arduino to make the [Sanyo MBC-55](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=473) keyboard usable with modern computers.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Laurence de Bruxelles](https://github.com/lfdebrux)
* Hardware Supported: N86D-2531-R001/02 PCB with controller replaced by Arduino Pro Micro
* Hardware Availability: Find someone selling one on [deskthority](https://deskthority.net/viewforum.php?f=11), then rewire it yourself

This keyboard was nicknamed "the Sanyo" in [Chyrosan22's video review of it](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=13970).

Inside it uses an NEC Î¼PD8049HC (a clone of the Intel MCS-48, I think) as the
controller, with a Texas Instruments SN74159 demultiplexer to select columns.
It uses an [idiosyncratic serial protocol](http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/sanyo.html)
which isn't much use for anything, since there isn't an ALT or META key and you
can't even use the CTRL key normally.

To be able to use QMK I replaced the controller with an Arduino Pro Micro; a
lot of the 40 pins on the original MCU are unused so you only need 16 pins, so
a Nano or a Micro would probably do just as well. I also ran a wire from the
external reset switch on the keyboard to the reset pin on the Arduino.

Read the comments in the code for more notes on this hardware conversion.
